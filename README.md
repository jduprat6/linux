## Comprehensive Linux and Security Lab Series

### Overview
In a series of lab activities, I focused on enhancing my practical skills in Linux, covering file and directory management, text editing, system setup, and configuring authorization. These labs have helped in developing my capabilities as a security analyst, using Linux-based systems.

### Lab Details and Skills Acquired

1. **Linux File and Directory Management**:
   - Practiced `pwd` for displaying the current working directory.
   - Used `ls` to list directory contents and `ls -l` for detailed file and directory information.
   - Created a Linux Tails bootable USB and installed Kali Linux on a wiped laptop.
   - Set up Kali Linux as a VM on a Windows 11 desktop using virtualBox, this includes making BIOS changes to allow CPU virtualization.

2. **Directory Structure Modification and Text Editing**:
   - `mkdir logs` to create a new logs subdirectory in `/home/analyst`.
   - `rmdir temp` to remove the temp subdirectory.
   - `mv Q3patches.txt /home/analyst/reports/` to move files between directories.
   - `rm tempnotes.txt` for deleting unnecessary files.
   - Used `nano` to edit `tasks.txt`, adding notes about changes made.

3. **Configuring Authorization and Permission Management**:
   - Navigated using `cd` to change directories and check file permissions.
   - Employed `chmod` for modifying file and directory permissions.
   - Executed `ls -la` to check hidden files and their permissions.
   - Altered permissions using `chmod g-r` and `chmod o-w` to limit file access.

### Comprehensive Skill Development

- **Command Line Proficiency**: Demonstrated command line efficiency in Linux, using a variety of commands for file system navigation and management.
- **System Configuration and Setup**: Gained practical experience in system configuration, including Linux installations and VM setups.
- **Text Editing**: Proficient in using text editors like nano for editing files, crucial for documentation and script editing.
- **Security Focus in System Management**: Developed a deep understanding of file permissions in Linux, reinforcing security and authorization concepts.

### Conclusion

These lab experiences have significantly contributed to my proficiency in Linux and cybersecurity. I've developed a strong foundation in system management, security practices, and efficient handling of Linux-based systems, making me well-equipped for roles in cybersecurity and system administration.
